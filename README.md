## epigeon

Do you have an alert system or server daemon that is capable of sending alerts via email but doesn't provide a way to interact with Twitter? (I'm looking at you, Monit.) Enter epigeon - a tiny application written in Go that makes this possible.

### Installing the Application

epigeon is easy to install. Just grab the latest binary from the releases tab. The application has no dependencies and therefore is distributed as a single executable. On Linux, this is as simple as `wget`-ing the file and adding the execute bit (`chmod +x`). On Windows, the execute bit isn't even required &mdash; just run the `.exe` directly.
